# Real-Estate-Market-Insights-Listing-Analysis
An SQL-based analysis revealing key real estate market trends and listing insights.

Data Source: Kaggle


Project Overview: Comprehensive Real Estate Market Analysis
Objective:

This project is designed to extract and analyze critical insights from a real estate listings dataset. By leveraging advanced SQL techniques, the analysis aims to understand market trends, property pricing, and listing features—ultimately providing a data-driven foundation for real estate investment and market strategy.

# Key Business Questions Addressed:

• Market Volume & Pricing: What is the total number of listings and the average pricing across the market?

• Location Performance: Which locations have the highest number of listings, and which ones offer the lowest average prices?

• Property Features: How do key property features—such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms—relate to pricing?

• Market Segmentation: How can properties be segmented into luxury and affordable markets?

Size-to-Price Relationship: How does property size correlate with price, and what are the average prices across different square footage ranges?

# Methodology:

1. Overall Metrics Calculation:
       
• Total Listings & Average Pricing: Using aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() to gauge overall market activity and pricing trends.

2. Location Analysis:

• High-Volume Locations: Grouping listings by location to determine which area hosts the most properties.

• Cost Efficiency: Sorting locations by average listing price to highlight markets with the lowest entry costs.

3. Feature-Based Filtering:

• Underpriced Properties: Identifying properties priced below the market average.
        
• Custom Search: Allowing for flexible filtering based on user-specified criteria (e.g., at least 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a price cap), making the data actionable for targeted buyers.

• High-Value & Luxury Listings: Isolating properties priced above $1,000,000 to understand the premium segment.

4. Comparative & Segmentation Analysis:
        
• Luxury vs. Affordable Markets: Using conditional logic (CASE statements) to classify and compare market segments based on pricing thresholds.
        
• Average Feature Analysis: Calculating average numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms per location to assess property quality and market expectations.

5. Size & Price Correlation:
        
• Square Footage Analysis: Creating size ranges with a CASE statement and determining the average price per segment. This insight aids in understanding how property size influences overall market pricing.
        
• Price Per Square Foot: Providing a detailed metric for property valuation and comparative market analysis.

# Value Proposition:

This project showcases a robust analytical approach by combining data aggregation, filtering, and segmentation to generate comprehensive insights into the real estate market.
